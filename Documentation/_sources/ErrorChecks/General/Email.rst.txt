Email
=====

Checks if a field contains a valid email and if a MX record exists for the domain of an email address.

If the user enters an email address like "user@example.tld", Formhandler checks if a valid MX record exists for the domain "example.tld".

This doesn't ensure that the mailbox "user@example.tld" exists or that the MX record points to a running server, but at least makes sure that there is a mail server setup for this domain.

              required {
                model = Required
              }
