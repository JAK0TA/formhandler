:ref:`General`
  These checks perform basic validation routines like checking if a field is filled out or if a field value is a valid email address.

:ref:`Arrays`
  Array checks are useful when dealing with arrays of check boxes and similar cases.

:ref:`Database`
  These checks allow you to ensure that a database record exists or doesn't exist.

:ref:`Date & Time <DateTime>`
  Using these error checks you can force the user to enter a valid date or time. You can even check for a valid date range.

:ref:`FileUpload`
  These are all available error checks dealing with file uploads. You can restrict allowed file types, set min and max uploadable files for one upload field and more.

:ref:`Numbers`
  If you want to perform error checks on numbers, e.g. if a field value is a valid integer, these checks are right for you.

:ref:`Strings`
  These error checks allow various checks suitable for strings, f.e. checking if a string is at least 10 characters long or if a string contains a specific word.
